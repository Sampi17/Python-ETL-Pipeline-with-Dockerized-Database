# 🐳 Dockerized ETL Pipeline

This repository contains a **Python ETL pipeline** that is fully containerized with **Docker** and uses a **PostgreSQL database** running in a separate container.  

---

## 📌 Project Goals
- Dockerize a Python ETL pipeline.  
- Run a PostgreSQL database in its own isolated container.  
- Use **Docker networking** to connect the ETL and database containers.  
- Write Python scripts to demonstrate:
  - **Extraction**
  - **Transformation**
  - **Loading**  
- Create a **Bash script** that:
  - Starts the containers.
  - Sets up the connections.
  - Runs the ETL pipeline in a fully automated way
